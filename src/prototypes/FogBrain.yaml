  sub: Continuous Reasoning for managing next-gen Cloud-Edge applications in continuity
    with the CI/CD pipeline
  text: Developing and releasing multiservice applications rely upon a pipeline of
    automation tools known as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. Among
    those tools, Continuous Reasoning is exploited by large companies to perform incremental
    static analyses on their code commits as soon as they are integrated into a shared
    codebase. Within this context, we extend continuous reasoning towards the continuous
    QoS- and context-aware management of multiservice applications in Cloud-IoT scenarios.
    FogBrainX is a novel continuous reasoning methodology that supports runtime decision
    on service placement by reacting both to changes in the infrastructure and in
    the application requirements, and capable of suggesting migrations only for services
    affected by such changes. Experimental results show that our approach brings considerable
    speed-up in comparison with an exhaustive search employing non-incremental reasoning.<br><br><a

    in Prolog and assessed through simulations over a realistic use case and over
    a lifelike motivating scenario at increasing infrastructure sizes. Experimental
    results show that our approach brings considerable speed-up in comparison with
    an exhaustive search employing non-incremental reasoning.</div>
