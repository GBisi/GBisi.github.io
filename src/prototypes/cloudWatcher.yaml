  sub: An open-source prototype tool to perform highly customisable fault and performance
    monitoring across multiple Clouds
  text: cloudWatcher aims at monitoring customised health metrics (e.g., the availability
    of a cloud service and its performance, the status of the network, the performance
    of a VM's disk) of multi-Cloud OpenStack systems, by providing configurable alerts
    associated with such measurements, and it is extensible to accommodate further
    metrics. Such an objective is pursued through a design that is based on a declarative
    and modular methodology for monitoring multiple datacentres (DCs).<br><br><a class="btn

    class="collapse" id="talk-0">Monitoring the proper functioning and performance
    of an infrastructure spanning multiple Cloud datacentres is challenging. It requires
    continuously aggregating monitored data across multiple source machines and processing
    them so to obtain useful alerts and insights. In this article, we propose a simple
    open-source prototype tool to perform highly customisable fault and performance
    monitoring across multiple Clouds. Differently from commercial tools, our prototype
    is simpler to deploy and it can be configured through a declarative approach,
    by simply specifying data monitoring tasks and aggregation policies. We illustrate
    such peculiarities over a use case relying on three datacentres under the Italian
    Research and Education Network Consortium.</div>
