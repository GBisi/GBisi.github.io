  sub: An open-source prototype tool to perform highly customisable fault and performance
    monitoring across multiple Clouds
  text: cloudWatcher aims at monitoring customised health metrics (e.g., the availability
    of a cloud service and its performance, the status of the network, the performance
    of a VM's disk) of multi-Cloud OpenStack systems, by providing configurable alerts
    associated with such measurements, and it is extensible to accommodate further
    metrics. Such an objective is pursued through a design that is based on a declarative
    and modular methodology for monitoring multiple datacentres (DCs).
