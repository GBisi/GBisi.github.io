    class="collapse" id="talk-4">Developing and releasing multiservice applications
    rely upon a pipeline of automation tools known as Continuous Integration/Continuous
    Deployment. Among those tools, continuous reasoning is exploited by large companies
    to perform incremental static analyses on their code commits as soon as they are
    integrated into a shared codebase. In this article, we extend continuous reasoning
    towards the continuous QoS- and context-aware management of multiservice applications
    in Cloud-IoT scenarios. We propose a novel continuous reasoning methodology that
    supports runtime decision on service placement by reacting both to changes in
    the infrastructure and in the application requirements, and capable of suggesting
    migrations only for services affected by such changes. The methodology is prototyped
    in Prolog and assessed through simulations over a realistic use case and over
    a lifelike motivating scenario at increasing infrastructure sizes. Experimental
    results show that our approach brings considerable speed-up in comparison with
    an exhaustive search employing non-incremental reasoning.</div>

    aim at improving our daily lives by automatically tuning ambient parameters (e.g.
    temperature, interior light) and by achieving energy savings through self-managing
    cyber-physical systems. Commercial solutions, however, only permit setting simple
    target goals on those parameters and do not consider mediating conflicting goals
    among different users and/or system administrators, and feature limited compatibility
    across different IoT verticals. In this article, we propose a declarative framework
    to represent smart environments, user-set goals and customisable mediation policies
    to reconcile contrasting goals encompassing multiple IoT systems. An open-source
    Prolog prototype of the framework is showcased over two lifelike motivating examples.</div>

    class="collapse" id="talk-1">Designing platforms and methodologies for the orchestration
    and management of multi-service applications in the Cloud-IoT continuum is becoming
    more and more a problem of primary importance, due to the current paradigm shifts
    in the applications development and the new computing paradigms. In light of these
    needs, in this thesis, we study and implement innovative orchestration techniques,
    based on the Continuous Reasoning approach, to achieve a scalable, continuous
    and QoS-compliant management of multi-service applications on large-scale, geographically
    distributed Cloud-IoT networks. We propose a declarative methodology, and its
    prototype FogBrainX, to speed up QoS-aware, decision-making in Cloud-IoT application
    management, and we design and develop a next-generation orchestrator prototype,
    FogArm, to perform continuous and QoS-compliant management of multi-service applications
    in Cloud-IoT settings, in continuity with either CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure
    distributed monitoring tools. Finally, both the methodology and the orchestrator
    are extensively assessed. To the best of our knowledge, FogArm represents a first
    complete prototype of a next-gen orchestrator for the continuous QoS-compliant
    management of multi-service applications on geographically distributed Cloud-IoT
    nodes.</div>
