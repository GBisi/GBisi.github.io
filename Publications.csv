"Continuous Reasoning for Application Management over the Cloud-IoT Continuum","G. Bisicchia","MSc Thesis, PhD Programme in Computer Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, a.y. 2021/2022","Thesis",2022,"https://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-06292022-170952/","https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/FogArmX",,,"Continuous Management of Multi-Service Applications over the Cloud-IoT Continuum.pdf",,,"Designing platforms and methodologies for the orchestration and management of multi-service applications in the Cloud-IoT continuum is becoming more and more a problem of primary importance, due to the current paradigm shifts in the applications development and the new computing paradigms. In light of these needs, in this thesis, we study and implement innovative orchestration techniques, based on the Continuous Reasoning approach, to achieve a scalable, continuous and QoS-compliant management of multi-service applications on large-scale, geographically distributed Cloud-IoT networks. We propose a declarative methodology, and its prototype FogBrainX, to speed up QoS-aware, decision-making in Cloud-IoT application management, and we design and develop a next-generation orchestrator prototype, FogArm, to perform continuous and QoS-compliant management of multi-service applications in Cloud-IoT settings, in continuity with either CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure distributed monitoring tools. Finally, both the methodology and the orchestrator are extensively assessed. To the best of our knowledge, FogArm represents a first complete prototype of a next-gen orchestrator for the continuous QoS-compliant management of multi-service applications on geographically distributed Cloud-IoT nodes.",true

An open-source Prolog prototype of the framework is showcased over two lifelike motivating examples.",true

Among those tools, continuous reasoning is exploited by large companies to perform incremental static analyses on their code commits as soon as they are integrated into a shared codebase. In this article, we extend continuous reasoning towards the continuous QoS- and context-aware management of multiservice applications in Cloud-IoT scenarios. We propose a novel continuous reasoning methodology that supports runtime decision on service placement by reacting both to changes in the infrastructure and in the application requirements, and capable of suggesting migrations only for services affected by such changes. The methodology is prototyped in Prolog and assessed through simulations over a realistic use case and over a lifelike motivating scenario at increasing infrastructure sizes. Experimental results show that our approach brings considerable speed-up in comparison with an exhaustive search employing non-incremental reasoning.",true
